🚗 ScrapNet – Intelligent Vehicle Scrapping Management System

ScrapNet is a full-stack digital platform designed to modernize and regulate the vehicle scrapping process. It ensures security, transparency, and fair pricing by integrating Blockchain, Machine Learning, and Web & Mobile Applications for all stakeholders involved.

📌 Problem Statement

Traditional vehicle scrapping systems often face issues such as:

Illegal or untracked scrapping

Lack of transparency in pricing

Manual verification processes

Data manipulation and fraud

ScrapNet addresses these challenges by providing a secure and automated ecosystem for vehicle scrapping.

🎯 Objectives

Digitize the vehicle scrapping workflow

Ensure transparency using blockchain technology

Predict fair scrap prices using machine learning

Enable secure communication between stakeholders

Issue official scrapping certificates through RTO

👥 User Roles

Admin – System monitoring and management

User – Requests vehicle scrapping

Scrap Dealer – Evaluates and processes vehicles

Police – Verifies vehicle legality

RTO – Issues scrapping certificates
